# v1.2.0 — Reliability Operations

Operational reliability milestone focused on faster incident recovery, proactive failure signal, and broader deterministic smoke coverage.

## Highlights

- Added failed-fixture rerun mode for smoke reliability runs:
  - `--rerun-failed` reruns only failed fixtures from the latest smoke artifact.
  - `--artifact <path>` allows explicit artifact override.
- Added webhook-based failure alerts for smoke and selector-health commands with stable payload structure.
- Added deterministic rotating regional matrix coverage:
  - `--matrix-mode default|extended`
  - `--rotation-key <token>`
  - Scheduled CI uses ISO-week rotation keys for predictable extended coverage.

## Behavioral Guarantees

- Live smoke pass still requires schema validation.
- Alert delivery failures are warning-only and do not override command exit status.
- Smoke artifacts include deterministic `selection` provenance for replay/debugging.

## Fixes

- Ensured rerun mode executes full failed-fixture sets (no sample truncation).
- Hardened rotation-key normalization for null-safe default behavior.
