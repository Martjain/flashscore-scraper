## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Milestone v1.3 init]: Focus scope on alert deduplication/cooldown and trend summaries (RELY-10/11)
- [Roadmap v1.3]: Sequence phases as dedupe controls first, trend summaries second
- [Phase 06]: Extended matrix selection uses stable rotation-key hashing to choose deterministic region slots
- [Phase 05]: Failure alerts remain CI-only by default and require explicit local override for developer runs

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None currently.
