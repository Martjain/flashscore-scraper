# Requirements: FlashscoreScraping

**Defined:** 2026-02-28
**Core Value:** Users can reliably extract structured league match results and statistics into reusable local data files with stable schema contracts.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for milestone v1.2 Reliability Operations. Each maps to exactly one roadmap phase.

### Recovery Workflow

- [x] **RELY-07**: User can rerun reliability smoke for only failed fixtures from the latest smoke artifact without manually enumerating fixture IDs.

### Alerting

- [x] **RELY-08**: User can receive chat/webhook alerts for smoke or selector-health failures that include run ID, failure stage, and affected fixture/scope identifiers.

### Coverage Expansion

- [x] **RELY-09**: User can execute a rotating extended smoke matrix grouped by region on scheduled runs while keeping default smoke runtime bounded for routine CI.

## v2 Requirements

Deferred beyond milestone v1.2.

### Reliability Enhancements

- **RELY-10**: User can configure alert deduplication/cooldown policies to reduce repeated notifications.
- **RELY-11**: User can inspect trend summaries of failure rates by fixture/region over time.

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from v1.2 scope.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Full global smoke matrix on every PR | Runtime and flake risk would degrade routine CI feedback |
| Multi-channel escalation routing | Adds policy complexity before baseline webhook workflow is validated |
| Automatic selector self-healing | Risks silent data corruption without explicit operator review |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| RELY-07 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| RELY-08 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| RELY-09 | Phase 6 | Complete |
