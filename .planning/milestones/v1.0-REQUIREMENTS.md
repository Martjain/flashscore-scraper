# Requirements: FlashscoreScraping

**Defined:** 2026-02-28
**Core Value:** Users can reliably extract structured league match results and statistics from Flashscore pages into reusable local data files.

## v1 Requirements

### Target Domain

- [x] **CORE-01**: Scraper uses `https://www.flashscoreusa.com` as the base domain for scraping flows

### Scraping Compatibility

- [x] **SCRP-01**: Country, league, and season discovery works against the Flashscore USA site structure
- [x] **SCRP-02**: Match listing, summary extraction, and statistics extraction work against the Flashscore USA site structure

### Data Output Compatibility

- [x] **DATA-01**: JSON, JSON-array, and CSV outputs keep backward-compatible field structure for existing consumers

## v2 Requirements

### Reliability Hardening

- **RELY-01**: Add selector fallback strategy and selector health checks for upstream DOM changes
- **RELY-02**: Add automated smoke checks for the end-to-end scrape flow against representative leagues

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Expanding to additional sports | Not required for this migration goal |
| Replacing Playwright with a different scraping stack | Adds risk without improving migration outcome |
| Redesigning CLI UX and arguments | Existing interfaces should remain stable |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| CORE-01 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| SCRP-01 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| SCRP-02 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| DATA-01 | Phase 1 | Complete |
